Project #1 Navigating a Networked Infrastructure

Brief
?	Understand what it means to be a single user on a multi-user system, and how to navigate virtual infrastructure online by various technical means.
?	Discern how the acquired technical skills may inform the topic or context for your ongoing project in this course, considering challenges surrounding data privacy, online security and tracing/tracking practices.
?	Develop an Information Architecture for your project or content using industry-standard software environments and design paradigms.
?	Going from the tutorials on the Command Line and Git, and looking at the Information Architecture (flow / flowcharts) examples, design the following:
?	An Information Architecture for a fake Internet project, website, or service. This could be anything from your own vision of a social networking service, to a multinational company website, or a personal portfolio.
?	Capture your design and/or structure in a flowchart, similar to the ones in the hand-in examples
?	Manifest the site/project structure by using your newly acquired command line skills (mkdir, cp, mv, etc.) and push them to your Github repository.
?	Post your flowchart in your journal (as an attachment or inline image), and post a link to your site/project structure on Github
